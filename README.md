Recipes Project on TOP

#Project Description
HTML: 
    Create an index page consisitng of a title and three links to chosen recipes. 

    All three recipes must have their own page consisting of a title, an image if the dish, a description 1-2 paragraphs in length, an unordered list for ingredients, titled appropriately, and an ordered list for instructions, also titled appropriately. 

#Where I Went Beyond
HTML: 
    I utilized semantic HTML to organize and label my content, incuding picture tags for all my images. 

    I also organized the recipe links on the index page into cards containing a thumbnail image, a title, and a short description. in addition to the link. 

    Ingredient and instruction lists were also placed into cards.

#Where I May Have Lacked
Content: 
    Instead of writing or copying descriptions for dishes, I added filler text to the appropriate length for all three recipe pages. Ingredients and Instructions were still copied from other recipes, and rewritten where apt.

#What I Plan on Doing Later
HTML: 
    Adding a footing section to timestamp and claim the project site

CSS: 
    Full styling of the site, including responsiveness.
